# sax js

A sax-style parser for XML and HTML.

Designed with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in
the browser or other CommonJS implementations.

## What This Is

* A very simple tool to parse through an XML string.
* A stepping stone to a streaming HTML parser.
* A handy way to deal with RSS and other mostly-ok-but-kinda-broken XML
  docs.

## What This Is (probably) Not

* An HTML Parser - That's a fine goal, but this isn't it.  It's just
  XML.
* A DOM Builder - You can use it to build an object model out of XML,
  but it doesn't do that out of the box.
* XSLT - No DOM = no querying.
* 100% Compliant with (some other SAX implementation) - Most SAX
  implementations are in Java and do a lot more than this does.
* An XML Validator - It does a little validation when in strict mode, but
  not much.
* A Schema-Aware XSD Thing - Schemas are an exercise in fetishistic
  masochism.
* A DTD-aware Thing - Fetching DTDs is a much bigger job.

## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE`s and `<!ENTITY`s

The parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute
values: `&amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;`. It's possible to define additional
entities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn't do anything
with that. If you want to listen to the `ondoctype` event, and then fetch
the doctypes, and read the entities and add them to `parser.ENTITIES`, then
be my guest.

Unknown entities will fail in strict mode, and
