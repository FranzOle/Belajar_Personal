# ASAP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kriskowal/asap.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kriskowal/asap)

Promise and asynchronous observer libraries, as well as hand-rolled callback
programs and libraries, often need a mechanism to postpone the execution of a
callback until the next available event.
(See [Designing API’s for Asynchrony][Zalgo].)
The `asap` function executes a task **as soon as possible** but not before it
returns, waiting only for the completion of the current event and previously
scheduled tasks.

```javascript
asap(function () {
    // ...
});
```

This CommonJS package provides an `asap` module that exports a function that
executes a task function *as soon as possible*.

ASAP strives to schedule events to occur before yielding for IO, reflow,
or redrawing.
Each event receives an independent stack, with only platform code in parent
frames and the events run in the order they are scheduled.

ASAP provides a fast event queue that will execute tasks until it is
empty before yielding to the JavaScript engine's underlying event-loop.
When a task gets added to a previously empty event queue, ASAP schedules a flush
event, preferring for that event to occur before the JavaScript engine has an
opportunity to perform IO tasks or rendering, thus making the first task and
subsequent tasks semantically indistinguishable.
ASAP uses a variety of techniques to preserve this invariant on different
versions of browsers and Node.js.

By design, ASAP prevents input events from being handled until the task
queue is empty.
If the process is busy enough, this may cause incoming connection requests to be
dropped, and may cause existing connections to inform the sender to reduce the
transmission rate or stall.
ASAP allows this on the theory that, if there is enough work to do, there is no
sense in looking for trouble.
As a consequence, ASAP can interfere with smooth animation.
If your task should be tied to the rendering loop, consider using
`requestAnimationFrame` instead.
A long sequence of tasks can also effect the long running script dialog.
If this is a problem, you may be able to use ASAP’s cousin `setImmediate` to
break long processes into shorter intervals and periodically allow the browser
to breathe.
`setImmediate` will yield for IO, reflow, and repaint events.
It also returns a handler and can be canceled.
For a `setImmediate` shim, consider [YuzuJS setImmediate][setImmediate].

Take care.
ASAP can sustain infinite recursive calls without warning.
It will not halt from a stack overflow, and it will not consume unbounded
memory.
This is behaviorally equivalent to an infinite loop.
Just as with infinite loops, you can monitor a Node.js process for this behavior
with a heart-beat signal.
As with infinite loops, a very small amount of caution g
