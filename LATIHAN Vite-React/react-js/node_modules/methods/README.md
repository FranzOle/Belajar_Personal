HTTP verbs that Node.js core's HTTP parser supports.

This module provides an export that is just like `http.METHODS` from Node.js core,
with the following differences:

  * All method names are lower-cased.
  * Contains a fallback list of methods for Node.js versions that do not have a
    `http.METHODS` export (0.10 and lower).
  * Provides the fallback list when using tools like `browserify`
